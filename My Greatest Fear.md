### My Greatest Fear

My greatest fear is **heights** with reasons.

<ul>
  <li>I tend to get nervous when I'm far up and my heart starts to beat fast</li>
  <li>I can't climb in certain height as my body would be shaky and not responsive.</li>
  <li>I don't even have the confidence to perticipate in indoor rock climbing in grade 8.</li>
  <li>Just looking down from above is just a really intimidating thing to do.</li>
</ul>
